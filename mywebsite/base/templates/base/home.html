					<h4>My first job as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>6 months after writing hello world program in the deep learning on October 7th 2019 (While working on Activity tracking project). I had convinced my program manager to let me take a stab at building a better version of the outdated Chatbot system building for Zendesk support agent.</p>

					<p>Before I knew it we transitioned from the old chatbot syatem and we're on to mine. Here, we will proceed by building a pipeline from dataset to DialogFlow for multiple intents.</p>

					<p>From this you'll see that I'm someone that jump before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototype first.</p>
					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a refrence.</p>
